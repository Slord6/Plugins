# Plugins
 C# Plugin System

## Write a plugin

- For a new project, add a reference to the `PluginBase` project
- Create a new class (or classes) which implements `IPlugin`

### Order of execution

- `OnLoad` is called as soon as the plugin is instantiated.
- `CreateTask` may be called at any time after `OnLoad` and before `OnUnload`. The returned task should implement the desired behaviour of the plugin.
- `OnUnload` may be called at any time after `OnLoad`. Note that it may be called before `CreateTask`, whilst a task is still running or after it has completed.


Loosely based on the .NET Core plugin system described [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/tutorials/creating-app-with-plugin-support)
